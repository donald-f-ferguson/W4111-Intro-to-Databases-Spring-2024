                    I am Anisha Gupta. I am a first-year graduate student in SEAS, studying Computer Science with a specialization in Software Systems. 
                    I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Vellore, India. 
                    Following my undergrad, I worked as a cloud developer in Hewlett-Packard enterprise for almost two years, 
                    where I implemented storage array functionalities in a cloud-native environment. 
                    While I haven’t taken this course at Columbia, I have done a similar course in my undergrad and it was one of my favorite college courses. 
                    I think it is extremely relevant for industries and gives a solid foundation to an upcoming software engineer. 
                    I love trying new food and enjoy exploring new restaurants. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, going on walks, or binge-watching shows on Netflix.

                    I'm a MSCS graduate student in my last semester. 
                    I took COMS6156 Cloud Computing with Professor Ferguson and I also have TA for the same class during Fall 2023. 
                    I'm currently a software engineer at Coinbase. I love working as a TA and developing my skills in teaching. 
                    I hope to one day work as a part time professor after completing MSCS.

                    I'm passionate about databases because they're the structural backbone of modern technology. My goal is to make the world of databases as exciting for other students as it is for me.
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of data, you'll often find me playing the piano or singing along to my favorite songs. Music is not just a hobby for me; it's a way to unwind and find inspiration.
                    I'm also a fan of video games, with "League of Legends" and "Ronki" being two of my absolute favorites.
